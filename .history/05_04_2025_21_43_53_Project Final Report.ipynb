    "A research group in Computer Science at UBC, led by Frank Wood, collected data about how people play video games. They set up a MineCraft server, where the data collected consisted of two datasets: players.csv and sessions.csv. Our report will look at how player characteristics predict their number of played hours on the server. \n",

    "Our group was interested in the “kinds” of players that are most likely to contribute a large amount of data, such that they can be targeted in recruiting efforts. To investigate this, we chose the specific research question: **Can gender, experience, and age predict the total number of minutes of playtime from the dataset?** On a broader scale, these insights can help video game companies develop strategies that enhance user experience and engagement across diverse populations.\n",

    "From the visualizations, we decided on choosing k-nn regression as our model.\n",
    "We chose k-nn regression because the relationship between the response variable and the predictor shows a nonlinear pattern. The assumption that was made for the KNN regression is that scaling is needed as the points should be in comparable scales in order to compare and calculate the distance between them. A limitation of this model is its slow performance – it must compute the distance of all the points inside the training set which can take time. In addition, the KNN method is also sensitive to the choice of k (number of neighbours). A value too small can lead to an overly sensitive model (overfitting) whilst a value too large can cause the model to ignore important local patterns (underfitting). \n",

This allows us to train our model on the majority of the data, while reserving a portion for testing to evaluate the model’s performance. Then in the training set, we will perform a 5-fold-cross-validation to choose the correct number of neighbors (k). The split will happen before the modelling and the cross-validation is done on the training data.  The cross-validation happens to ensure that there will be an optimal value of K before testing it, leading to a more stable performance of the k-NN when estimating. "
